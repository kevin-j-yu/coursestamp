now let's talk about the problem of if
we<00:06:20.370><c> think</c><00:06:20.550><c> overfitting</c><00:06:21.150><c> is</c><00:06:21.360><c> occurring</c><00:06:21.870><c> what</c>

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
we think overfitting is occurring what
 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.460 align:start position:0%
we think overfitting is occurring what
can<00:06:22.560><c> we</c><00:06:22.680><c> do</c><00:06:22.889><c> to</c><00:06:23.190><c> address</c><00:06:23.400><c> it</c><00:06:23.820><c> in</c><00:06:24.750><c> the</c><00:06:25.080><c> previous</c>

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 align:start position:0%
can we do to address it in the previous
 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.500 align:start position:0%
can we do to address it in the previous
examples<00:06:25.979><c> we</c><00:06:26.130><c> had</c><00:06:26.490><c> one</c><00:06:26.850><c> or</c><00:06:27.090><c> two</c><00:06:27.120><c> dimensional</c>

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 align:start position:0%
examples we had one or two dimensional
 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
examples we had one or two dimensional
data<00:06:27.810><c> so</c><00:06:28.650><c> we</c><00:06:28.740><c> could</c><00:06:28.889><c> just</c><00:06:29.070><c> plot</c><00:06:29.340><c> the</c>

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
data so we could just plot the
 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
data so we could just plot the

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 align:start position:0%
hypothesis and see what was going on and
 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.250 align:start position:0%
hypothesis and see what was going on and
select<00:06:32.460><c> the</c><00:06:32.729><c> appropriate</c><00:06:32.820><c> degree</c><00:06:33.510><c> polynomial</c>

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
select the appropriate degree polynomial
 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.010 align:start position:0%
select the appropriate degree polynomial
so<00:06:34.770><c> earlier</c><00:06:35.280><c> for</c><00:06:35.970><c> the</c><00:06:36.330><c> housing</c><00:06:36.810><c> prices</c>

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
so earlier for the housing prices

example<00:06:37.680><c> we</c><00:06:37.860><c> could</c><00:06:38.040><c> just</c><00:06:38.220><c> plot</c><00:06:38.580><c> the</c>

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 align:start position:0%
example we could just plot the
 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.480 align:start position:0%

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 align:start position:0%

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 align:start position:0%

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
predict housing prices and we could then
 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.860 align:start position:0%
