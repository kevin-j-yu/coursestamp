00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.250
What this machine learning?

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.470
in this video, we will try to define what it is and also try to give you a sense of when you want to use machine learning

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.879
Even among machine learning practitioners there isn't a well accepted definition of what is and what isn't machine learning?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.439
But let me show you a couple of examples of the ways that people have tried to Define it

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.180
Here's the definition of what is machine learning that is due to author Samuel?

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.319
He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability [to] learn without being explicitly programmed

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.790
Samuels claim to fame was that back in the 1950s

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.979
He wrote a checkers playing program and the amazing thing about this checkers playing program

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.209
Was that [officer] samuel [himself] wasn't a very good checkers player?

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.889
but what he did was he had the program play tens of thousands of games against itself and

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.839
By watching what sorts of board [positions] tended to lead to wins and what sort of board positions?

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.339
Tended to Veto losses the checkers playing program learned over time

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.379
What are good board positions and what a bad board positions and eventually learned to play checkers better than arthur Samuel himself was able [to]

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.349
This was a remarkable result also samuel [himself] turned out not to be a very good checkers player

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.689
But because the computer has the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.509
No, human has the patience to play that many games

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.869
By doing this the computer was able to get so much checkers playing experience that it eventually

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.710
Became a better checkers player than offered Samuel himself

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.549
This is [somewhat] informal definition and an older one here's a slightly more recent definition by Tom Mitchell

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.949
Who is a friend out in Committee Mellon?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.549
So Tom defines machine learning by saying that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.990
He says a computer program is said to learn from experience II with respect to some [tosti] and some performance measure key

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.600
Evidence Performance on t as measured by P

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.389
Improves of experience II I actually think he came up with this definition just to make it wrong

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.989
For the checkers playing examples the experience II would be the experience of having the program play tens of thousands of games against itself

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.769
The task t would be the task of playing checkers and the performance measure p would be the probability

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.000
That wins the next game of checkers against some new opponent

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.899
Throughout these [videos] besides me trying to teach you stuff

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.539
I'll occasionally ask you a question to make sure you understand the content. Here's one on

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.798
top of the definition of machine learning by Tom mcCullar

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.379
Let's say your email program watches which emails you do or do not [value] spam

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.369
so in an email client like [this] you might click [this] spam button to report some email as spam but not other emails and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.810
Based on which emails you marcus them say your email program

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.530
learns better how to filter a spam email

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.250
what is the task of [t] in the setting in a few seconds the video will pause and when it does so

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.809
you can use your mouse to select one [of] these four radio buttons to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.519
Let to let me know which of these four you think is the right answer to this question

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.469
So hopefully you got that this is the right answer classifying emails is a toss t in fact

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.549
this definition defines the task t a performance measure p and the some experience [E] and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.299
so watching you label emails as spam or non-sPam this would be the experience E and

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.619
the [fraction] of emails correctly classified that might be our performance measure p and

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.249
So our task performance on the [task] [about] systems performance on the task t on

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.810
the performance measure p will improve after the experience e

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.489
In this course I hope to teach you about various different types of learning algorithms

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.759
there are several different types of learning algorithms the main two types are what we call supervised learning and

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.600
unsupervised learning

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.009
I'll define what these terms mean more in the next couple videos

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.790
But it turns out that in supervised learning the idea is we're going to teach the how to do something

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.310
Whereas in unsupervised learning

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.850
We're going to let it learn by itself don't worry if these two terms. Don't make sense yet in the next two videos

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.089
I'm going to say exactly what these two types of learning on

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.000
you will also hear all the buzz terms such as

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.560
reinforcement learning and

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.120
recommender systems

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.470
These are other types of machine learning algorithms that we'll talk about later

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.870
but the two most used types of learning algorithms are probably supervised learning and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.109
Unsupervised learning and I'll define them in the next two videos and we'll spend most as far as talking about these two types of learning

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.650
algorithms

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.690
It turns out one of the other things we'll spend a lot of time on in this class is practical advice for applying learning algorithms

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.780
This is something [that] I feel pretty strongly about and exactly something that I don't know of any other [university] teachers

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.680
Teaching about learning algorithms. It's like giving you a set of tools and

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.220
Equally important or more important than giving you the tools is to teach you how to apply these tools

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.489
I like to make an analogy to learning to become a carpenter

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.979
Imagine that someone is teaching you how to be a carpenter, and they say here's a hammer

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.299
Here's a drive screwdriver is a saw good luck well

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.359
That's no good right you have all these tools, but the more important thing is to learn how to use these tools properly

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.310
There's a huge difference

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.119
We can keep between people that know how to use these machine learning algorithms versus people that don't know how to use these tools well

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.460
here in Silicon Valley when I live

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.900
When I go visit different companies even at the top silicon Valley companies very often I see people trying to apply Machine learning

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.220
Algorithms to some problem and sometimes there have been going at it for six months

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.559
But sometimes when I look at what they're [doing]

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.519
I say you know, I could have told them like gee I could have told you six months ago

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.419
or that you should be taking a learning algorithm, and applying it in like the slightly modified way and

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.140
Your chance of success would have been much higher um

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.620
So what we're going to do in this class is [actually] spend a lot of time talking about how if you're actually trying to develop

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.229
a machine learning system

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:30.389
How to make those best practices types decisions about the way in which you build your system, so that when you apply learning algorithm

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.519
You're less likely to end up one of those people who end up pursuing somehow for six months that you know

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.110
Someone else could have figured out [just] wasn't gonna work at all and it's a waste of time for six months

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.379
So I'm actually spend a lot of time teaching you

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.239
Those sorts of best practices in Machine learning and AI and how to get [the] stuff to work

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.560
And how we do it or how the best people do it in Silicon Valley and around the world

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.189
I hope to make you one of the best people and knowing how to design and build serious machine learning and Ai systems

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.509
So that's machine learning and these are the main [topics]. I hope to teach in the next video. I'm going to Define

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:13.528
What is supervised learning and after that what is unsupervised learning and also start to talk about when you will use each of them?
