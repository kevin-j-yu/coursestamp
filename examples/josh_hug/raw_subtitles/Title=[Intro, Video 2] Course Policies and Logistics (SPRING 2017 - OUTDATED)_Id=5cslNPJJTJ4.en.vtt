gonna work in a team of people a pair of

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 align:start position:0%
people kind of will talk about how it's
 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.890 align:start position:0%
people kind of will talk about how it's
a<00:04:57.100><c> little</c><00:04:57.190><c> more</c><00:04:57.340><c> complicated</c><00:04:57.610><c> much</c><00:04:58.210><c> later</c><00:04:58.450><c> but</c>

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 align:start position:0%
a little more complicated much later but
 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.970 align:start position:0%
a little more complicated much later but
basically<00:04:59.020><c> we'll</c><00:04:59.320><c> work</c><00:04:59.470><c> with</c><00:04:59.650><c> a</c><00:04:59.710><c> group</c><00:04:59.950><c> of</c>

basically we'll work with a group of

basically we'll work with a group of

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 align:start position:0%
solve the problem
 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
solve the problem
so<00:05:02.980><c> unlike</c><00:05:03.340><c> programming</c><00:05:03.820><c> classes</c><00:05:04.180><c> you</c><00:05:04.270><c> might</c>

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 align:start position:0%
so unlike programming classes you might
 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.230 align:start position:0%
so unlike programming classes you might

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
that we have 14 of those they're worth

it doesn't come to more points than that
 

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come to more points than that

these last two projects two and three
 

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.890 align:start position:0%
these last two projects two and three
they<00:12:20.070><c> have</c><00:12:20.190><c> extra</c><00:12:20.430><c> credit</c><00:12:20.640><c> opportunities</c><00:12:21.210><c> if</c>

they have extra credit opportunities if
 

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.730 align:start position:0%
they have extra credit opportunities if
you<00:12:22.050><c> turn</c><00:12:22.350><c> in</c><00:12:22.650><c> the</c><00:12:23.900><c> the</c><00:12:24.900><c> code</c><00:12:25.110><c> early</c><00:12:25.530><c> enough</c>

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
you turn in the the code early enough
 

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.620 align:start position:0%
you turn in the the code early enough
that<00:12:25.950><c> you</c><00:12:26.190><c> pass</c><00:12:26.400><c> the</c><00:12:26.610><c> early</c><00:12:26.850><c> submission</c><00:12:27.270><c> tests</c>

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:27.630 align:start position:0%
that you pass the early submission tests
 

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.180 align:start position:0%
that you pass the early submission tests
so<00:12:27.900><c> basically</c><00:12:28.140><c> it'll</c><00:12:28.290><c> be</c><00:12:28.410><c> some</c><00:12:28.560><c> early</c><00:12:28.860><c> tests</c>

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.190 align:start position:0%
so basically it'll be some early tests
 

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.290 align:start position:0%
so basically it'll be some early tests
and<00:12:29.310><c> if</c><00:12:29.370><c> you</c><00:12:29.460><c> get</c><00:12:29.640><c> those</c><00:12:29.760><c> right</c><00:12:29.880><c> you'll</c><00:12:30.180><c> get</c>
